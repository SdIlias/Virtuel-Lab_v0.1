# Mini Virtual Laboratory – 3D Automation and Robotics
## 📚 Project Overview
Mini Virtual Laboratory is an interactive educational platform that allows users to customize, produce, and interact with a robotic production line in 3D.
This project combines robotics, 3D modeling, automation programming, and mathematical tools to simulate the production of wiping vacuum cleaners in a fully immersive virtual environment.

Developed as part of the Mathematical Tools for Engineers module (IAGI-1, 2023–2024).

## ✨ Features
🛠️ Robot product customization (select models, colors, features)

🏭 Realistic simulation of an automated production line

🔗 Use of Finite State Machines (FSM) to manage the production process

📊 Optimization with mathematical tools and programmable automata

🕹️ Real-time interaction: model selection, robot testing

🧪 Testing area for different robot prototypes

🚚 Automated storage simulation with autonomous transport robots

🎮 Developed with Unity 3D, C#, and Python for process optimization

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Unity 3D (game engine for 3D modeling and interactions)

C# (programming the production states and interactions)

Blender (3D modeling of components)

Python (mathematical modeling of automata)

NetworkX (automata visualization)

PyCharm (Python development environment)


## 🔥 Key Concepts
Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA): Ensures safe and reliable production flows

Complete Automaton: Handles all possible inputs

Automaton Minimization: Performance optimization

FSM in Unity: Modular scripts for each station (Init, Insertion, Inspection, Packaging, Final)

## 📈 Results and Insights
